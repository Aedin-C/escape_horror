# Escape Horror

A month ago, every member of the Arcanum Project vanished without a trace.

You’ve been sent by the Eidos Institute to the remote Grisham Estate, where their last transmissions originated. Little is known about the estate itself — only that it was purchased by Dr. Rourke, a man obsessed with its strange, unexplained properties. Over time, more scientists joined his efforts, drawn into his secretive research.

Then, the reports began. Whispers of unease. Notes describing the feeling of being watched. Shadows moving where no one stood. The Institute dismissed them as nerves — until the first scientist, Dr. Kell, failed to check in. Soon after, the others followed. Then... silence.

Now, the Institute needs answers.

Your mission: uncover what happened inside the Grisham Estate — and recover whatever records remain.
